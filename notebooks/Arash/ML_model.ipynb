    "Because we consider the revenue a continuous variable, we call this a _regression_ problem. It is common to evaluate regression problems according to some deviation measure of the error (difference) between the predictions and the ground truth values. Typical choices are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and its square root, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, both of these measures are quite sensitive to extreme values and work best if the typical scale of prediction errors are consistent across the dataset. This is not likely to be the case here because the revenue variable varies a lot. This means that a, say 10%, prediction error would matter a lot more if it is for one of the higher-earning stores than for one of the lower-earning ones. Consequently, we will use a variation that takes a log transform of the target variable before computing prediction errors.\n",
